```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(broom)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(WDI)
```

```{r import_data}
covid_data <- readr::read_csv(file = "../data/owid-covid-data.csv")
covid_data_codebook <- readr::read_csv(file = "../data/owid-covid-codebook.csv")
```

## Data Cleaning and Manipulation

The data is from 2020-02-24 to 2022-02-24
```{r data-cleaning, include=FALSE}
covid_total <- covid_data %>%
  filter(date == "2022-02-24")

covid_country <- covid_total %>%
  filter(is.na(continent) == FALSE)

covid_other <- covid_total %>%
  filter(is.na(continent) == TRUE)
```

```{r create-variables}
covid_country <- covid_country %>%
  mutate(percentage_cases = total_cases/population) %>%
  mutate(percentage_deaths = total_deaths/population)
covid_country     
```

## Create subsets of data

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
