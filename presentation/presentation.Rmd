# Introduction 

COVID-19, also known as Coronavirus disease 2019 is a contagious disease caused by a virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

Up until yesterday, there are over 497,057,239 infections and 6,179,104 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic

Although no one can predict a pandemic like this, with the help of data, we might be able to use available data to, for example, evaluate risks, so that the virus and mutations can be better managed or even contained in earlier stages

---

## Research Question

- In our research, we are trying to use Covid-19 related data, together with other relevant
data to find potential predictors for Covid-19 cases, deaths, or vaccination rates. 

? Do vaccinations effectively mitigate the death rate 

? Can stricter policies better contain the virus and control the death rate

? What about other variables in predicting Covid-19

? Use of machine learning algorithm to predict Covid-19

- The unpredictability of the progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be attributed to the low precision of the tools used to predict the prognosis of this disease, especially when the virus is mutating in a fast speed from alpha, to Omicron, and there are more recent variants too

# Data

## Data - details

The dataset is coming from "Our World in Data" Covid-19 public data, together with data from JHU, WHO, CDC and World Bank. The data covers a wide range:

- Basic Covid-19 data (cases, deaths)
- Hospital & ICU (ICU beds, ICU patients)
- Policy responses (stringency_index)
- Health info (Reproduction rate, diabetes prevalence)
- Tests & positivity
- Vaccinations
- Others (populations, life_expectancy, GDP per catpita and so on)

# Maching Learning

Machine learning algorithms can minimize forecasting error and do the forecast much faster and with the usage of more data. What's more, machine learning algorithms can analyze many alternative models at the same time, when in traditional econometrics you can analyze just one model at a time

# Maching Learning (KNN)

What is KNN?

Let’s assume we have several groups of labeled samples. In our sample, this might be countries that do well in coping with Covid-19 and countries that did not do well. Now, suppose we have an unlabeled example which needs to be classified into one of the several labeled groups.

# Limitations and Potential Future Studies

# Limitations 

1. Level of data

2. Mutations of Covid-19, types of vaccinations

3. Policies

4. Others

---

# Future Studies
1. Tracking recovery for children and elder population (sequelae, mental health)

2. Studying the transitioning in traditional industries (airlines, manufacturing)

3. Anti-trust activities during Covid-19

4. County level data
